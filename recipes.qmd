## **Ingredients:**

1.  **Space-aged Brioche Bread:**

    -   4 slices of brioche bread infused with edible glitter for that interstellar sparkle.

2.  **Celestial Cheese Blend:**

    -   1 cup shredded mozzarella (for its gooey, melty properties)

    -   1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese (for a tangy, otherworldly flavor)

    -   1/4 cup grated parmesan (for a touch of earthly sophistication)

3.  **Stellar Spread:**

    -   2 tbsp cosmic mayonnaise (mayo mixed with a pinch of edible stardust)

    -   1 tbsp galactic mustard (spicy mustard with a hint of meteorite pepper)

4.  **Interplanetary Extras:**

    -   1/2 cup sautéed mushrooms (resembling extraterrestrial fungi)

    -   1/4 cup caramelized onions (for a sweet and savory dimension)

    -   4 slices of asteroid bacon (extra crispy)

**Instructions:**

1.  **Prepare the Galactic Spread:**

    -   In a small bowl, mix the mayonnaise with a pinch of edible stardust to create a cosmic mayo. Set aside.

    -   Combine the spicy mustard with a hint of meteorite pepper to form the galactic mustard. Set aside.

2.  **Assemble the Cosmic Cheese Blend:**

    -   In another bowl, blend the mozzarella, blue cheese, and parmesan. This mixture will be your celestial cheese blend.

3.  **Construct the Grilled Cheese Galaxy:**

    -   Lay out the brioche slices and spread the cosmic mayo on one side of each slice.

    -   On the non-mayo side of two slices, layer the celestial cheese blend, making sure to distribute it evenly.

    -   Add the sautéed mushrooms, caramelized onions, and asteroid bacon on top of the cheese.

4.  **Form the Galactic Sandwich:**

    -   Place the remaining slices of brioche on top, mayo side facing inwards, to create two sandwich masterpieces.

5.  **Grill to Galactic Perfection:**

    -   Heat a skillet or pan over medium heat.

    -   Grill each side of the sandwich until the bread turns golden brown, and the cheese is fully melted, forming a crispy, celestial crust.

6.  **Serve and Enjoy the Extraterrestrial Feast:**

    -   Slice the sandwiches diagonally for an extra cosmic touch.

    -   Serve with a side of meteorite dusted potato wedges or Saturn ring onion rings.
